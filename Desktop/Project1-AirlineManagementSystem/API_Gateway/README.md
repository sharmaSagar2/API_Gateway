FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- we need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices
-Using this middle-end , when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actually respond to this request
-we can do message validation , response tranformation,rate limiting
-we try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle-end.
